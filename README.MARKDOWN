# Sup. 

This is a collection of my tests/experiments for the penkit python library. The original author licensed their work
under the MIT license, and thus penkit itself is still under the MIT license, however any of my files are licensed as usual
under CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0. This repo is a work in progress.

### Fractals2electricboogaloo

This notebook is a collection of L systems. At the top, set the default save directory so when you
run the cells the images get saved where you want them. You'll note some do repeat, but the formulas themselves
should be different.

## License Exception 

You may use my files for commercial purposes provided the following:
- You still refer to this respository as the source
- You sell your work for a reasonable price. Use common sense here, a US letter sheet of nice cardstock with something plotted
on it shouldn't cost more than $10, maybe $20 (at the time of writing 2024, USD). Basically, if you're charging 100x bill of materials,
you're doing too much.
- You do NOT create NFT's or somehow utilize my work for the training of AI or the generation of AI images. You can use AI for code generation from my work. 
- You're not a mega corporation. Or really any corporation with a value over $1 million USD.
- You somehow use my work for harm? Not sure how but don't do that.

This exception is meant for small artists or studios, and should be a supplementation to one's own work, not the only
thing they sell.
